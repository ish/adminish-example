This example project should run by setting up a couchdb server. Including a bunch of requirements in parralel (e.g. both this project and it's requirements all under a single directory). and running the following

./recreate-database.sh
./serve.sh

Here are the current requirements which should all be fetched from github (http://github.com/ish/<name>

restish
schemaish
formish
validatish
convertish
clevercss
wsgiapptools
couchish
couchdb-session
dottedish
jsonish
pagingish
adminish

At some point, before April 2009 hopefully, all of these modules will be eggified and uploaded to PyPI .

THIS IS NOT PRODUCTION READY CODE YET. BE WARNED.
